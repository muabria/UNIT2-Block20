In the starter repository, an index.js file should already be present with an array of "users" including name, age, and occupation.
In your index.html, create a full HTML document with a single div with an ID of "root".
Inside your main() function, grab the "root" element, add an h1 element, give it text of "FREELANCERS", and append the HTML document.
Continue working inside your main() function to create an unordered list element.
Loop through the users array creating li elements. 
Append those elements to your HTML document.
Style your site using CSS.
